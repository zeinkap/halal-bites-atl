## Testing

- **End-to-End Testing:**
  - Playwright for E2E testing
  - Test coverage for critical user flows:
    - Adding new restaurants
    - Handling duplicate restaurant submissions
    - Form validation
    - Toast notifications
    - Search functionality

### Running Tests

1. Install Playwright browsers:
   ```bash
   npx playwright install
   ```

2. Run all tests:
   ```bash
   npm run test
   ```

3. Run tests with UI mode:
   ```bash
   npm run test:ui
   ```

4. Run tests in debug mode:
   ```bash
   npx playwright test --debug
   ```

### Test Structure

Tests are located in the `/tests` directory and follow these conventions:
- Each feature has its own test file (e.g., `add-restaurant.spec.ts`)
- Tests use data-testid attributes for reliable element selection
- Async operations use appropriate timeouts and waits
- Test data is cleaned up after each test run

### Writing Tests

When writing new tests:
1. Use data-testid attributes for element selection
2. Follow the existing patterns for handling async operations
3. Include proper cleanup in the test teardown
4. Add appropriate assertions and error checks

- Images are automatically:
  - Optimized for quality and size
  - Resized to appropriate dimensions
  - Served through Cloudinary's global CDN
  - Converted to modern formats (WebP) when supported

## Database Schema

The application uses Prisma with PostgreSQL (Neon) as the database. Here's the schema structure:

### Restaurant Model
```prisma
model Restaurant {
  id                String      @id @default(cuid())
  name              String      @unique
  cuisineType       CuisineType
  address           String      @unique
  description       String?
  priceRange        PriceRange
  hasPrayerRoom     Boolean     @default(false)
  hasOutdoorSeating Boolean     @default(false)
  isZabiha          Boolean     @default(false)
  hasHighChair      Boolean     @default(false)
  servesAlcohol     Boolean     @default(false)
  isFullyHalal      Boolean     @default(false)
  imageUrl          String?
  createdAt         DateTime    @default(now())
  updatedAt         DateTime    @updatedAt
  comments          Comment[]
}

model Comment {
  id           String     @id @default(cuid())
  content      String
  rating       Int        @default(5)
  authorName   String
  restaurantId String
  createdAt    DateTime   @default(now())
  updatedAt    DateTime   @updatedAt
  imageUrl     String?
  restaurant   Restaurant @relation(fields: [restaurantId], references: [id])

  @@index([restaurantId])
}

enum CuisineType {
  MIDDLE_EASTERN
  INDIAN_PAKISTANI
  TURKISH
  PERSIAN
  MEDITERRANEAN
  AFGHAN
  CAFE
  MEXICAN
  CHINESE
  THAI
  OTHER
}

enum PriceRange {
  LOW    @map("$")
  MEDIUM @map("$$")
  HIGH   @map("$$$")
}
```

## Prisma Commands

Here are some useful Prisma commands for managing the database:

```bash
# Generate Prisma Client after schema changes
npx prisma generate

# Create a new migration
npx prisma migrate dev

# Reset the database and run all migrations
npx prisma migrate reset --force

# Seed the database with initial data
npx prisma db seed

# Open Prisma Studio to view/edit data
npx prisma studio
```

## Project Structure

- `/prisma` - Contains database schema and migrations
  - `schema.prisma` - Database schema definition
  - `seed.ts` - Database seeding script
- `/src/lib` - Contains utility functions

## Deploy

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new) from the creators of Next.js.

The production site is live at [https://halalbitesatl.org](https://halalbitesatl.org)

For database deployment, we're using:
- [Neon](https://neon.tech/) - Serverless Postgres with separate dev/prod branches

## Seeding Prod Database

Easiest way is to run the seed command with the database URL directly via:
`DATABASE_URL="PASTE_HERE" npx ts-node scripts/seed.ts`

To verify data is actually in the Prod database, run this query:
`DATABASE_URL="PASTE_HERE" npx prisma studio`

Run these commands to migrate and seed prod database:
`npm run migrate-prod && npm run seed-prod`

### Backing Up the Production Database

Before running migrations or seeding in production, it is highly recommended to back up your database. If you are using PostgreSQL, you can use the following command (requires `pg_dump` to be installed):

```sh
pg_dump "<your_production_database_url>" > prod-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).sql
```

For example, with Neon:

```sh
pg_dump "postgresql://neondb_owner:YOUR_PASSWORD@YOUR_HOST/neondb?sslmode=require" > prod-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).sql
```

This will create a timestamped SQL backup file in your current directory.

**Restoring from backup:**
To restore your database from a backup file, use:

```sh
psql "<your_production_database_url>" < prod-backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.sql
```

## Troubleshooting

### UI Not Reflecting Database Changes

If you notice discrepancies between Prisma Studio and the UI (e.g., updated cuisine types not showing):

1. Stop the Next.js server:
   ```bash
   pkill -f "next dev"
   ```

2. Clear Next.js cache:
   ```bash
   rm -rf .next
   ```

3. Regenerate Prisma client:
   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   ```

4. Restart the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Refresh your browser to see the changes.

### Redis Caching System

The application uses Redis for high-performance caching with automatic invalidation:

- **Restaurant List Caching:**
  - 5-minute cache duration for public endpoints
  - Automatic cache invalidation on:
    - Restaurant updates
    - Restaurant deletions
    - New restaurant creation
  - Significant performance improvement (5x faster responses)
  - Graceful fallback to database
  - Transaction-safe cache updates

### Setting up Redis:

1. Create an Upstash Redis database:
   - Visit [https://upstash.com/](https://upstash.com/)
   - Create a new database
   - Choose the region closest to your deployment

2. Add Redis credentials to `.env`:
   ```env
   UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL="https://your-url.upstash.io"
   UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN="your-token"
   ```

### Cache Implementation:

The caching system is implemented in both public and admin API routes:
```typescript
// Public endpoint - GET restaurants with caching
const cachedData = await redis.get(RESTAURANTS_CACHE_KEY);
if (cachedData) {
  return NextResponse.json(cachedData);
}

// Cache miss - fetch from database
const restaurants = await prisma.restaurant.findMany();
await redis.set(RESTAURANTS_CACHE_KEY, restaurants, {
  ex: CACHE_TTL // 5 minutes
});

// Admin endpoints - Automatic cache invalidation
await prisma.$transaction([
  // Database operations
]);
await redis.del(RESTAURANTS_CACHE_KEY); // Clear cache after changes
```
